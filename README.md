# qb-ox_inventory
This is a wrapper resource that covers exports and OpenInventory event of qb-inventory that modifies its behavior to work with ox_inventory out of the box.

Aim of this resource is to satisfy the need of converting every resource that uses qb-inventory system to ox_inventory.

This is still a <b>work-in-progress</b> and I was able to get <b>stashes working</b> so far.
